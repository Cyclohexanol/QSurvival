# QSurvival

A simple survival game simulation. An agent has a queue of 10'000 actions. The goal is that he survives for that many turn. Every turn he loses hunger, tiredness and thirst. Upon death, his action queue is slightly mutated and the simulation is reset.

## Step 2

Implement a population with various queues of actions. Simulate them independently but simultaneously and keep only the fittest. This aims to speed up the resolution of the problem.

## Step 3

Add new obstacles such as wolfs or weather conditions.
